## Project Focus
Crosley Tower Defense is a tower defense game set on UC's campus. The goal is to defend the now ill-fated Crosley Tower from demolition.

Players will be able to strategically place students to protect the tower from waves of Triceracopters (as found in Langsam Library) who remove the tower floor by floor. Each student will be representitive of one of around 5 majors offered at UC, and have abilities depending on their field of study (Architects may rebuild floors, Cybersecurity students may be able to hack the opposition, etc.). The game ends once the tower finally has 0 floors left. The gameplay loop is intended to be infinite and scale accordingly after each wave. If time allows, a leaderboard will be implemented so players are able to share scores with each other.

The view is planned to be isometric. For visuals, simple art will suffice and interested artists from DAAP may be contacted to help create game art for the end of the project.

The goal is to create a game that is a topical and fun way to bolster school spirit among studnets, especially incoming 2026 freshmen.

## Meeting Frequency
