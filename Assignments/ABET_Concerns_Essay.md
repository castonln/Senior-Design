CS Senior Design 1

My project includes economic, legal, and cultural constraints. Financially, my project is
supported by an extremely small budget limited to my own wallet. For this reason, I’m using the
Unity game engine for my project’s development. Unity has a free licensing plan available for
businesses and creators who earn under $200k a year. This allows me to learn the program
without worrying about payment. Legally, my project utilizes some iconic imagery associated
with the University of Cincinnati (Crosley Tower and the Triceracopter). Fair Use typically
protects parody works, and I do not plan to profit off the work. I have considered this constraint
carefully and made sure my work is not intentionally disrespectful or critical of UC in order to not
raise any concerns about any use of iconography. Culturally, I plan to feature placeable students
to defend the objective of the game. I want these students to represent an accurate slice of the
UC student body, both in portrayals of majors and ethnicities. Players of the game will be from
UC, so I want players to be comfortable by playing a major similar to theirs or seeing their
background represented on screen.
