## Abstract

Crosley Tower Defense is a tower defense game set on UC's campus. The goal is to defend the now ill-fated Crosley Tower from demolition. Players will be able to strategically place students to protect the tower from waves of Triceracopters (as found in Langsam Library) who remove the tower floor by floor. Each student will be representative of one of around 5 majors offered at UC, and have abilities depending on their field of study. The goal is to create a game that is a topical and fun way to bolster school spirit among students, especially incoming 2026 freshmen.
