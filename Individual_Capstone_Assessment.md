Individual Capstone Assessment

My senior design project is all about using what I've learned while here at the University of Cincinnati to create a fun experience to share with others and learn some new skills along the way. Through my project, Crosley Tower Defense, I am to accomplish this. Crosley Tower Defense is a tower defense game set on UC's campus. Players will place students, representitive of UC's majors, to defend the tower for as long as they can. I'd like to implement a public leaderboard to the game as well. I'm hoping this game will be shared among students and be a fun way to connect with others.

The courses I've taken while at UC will assist me in this project. Out of all of them, Software Engineering (CS 3093C) will definitely be the most useful. I learned about project management, version control, and finishing complex software to completion during that class. All of those topics are useful to my Senior Design concept. Another class may be Data Structures (CS 2028), as it has informed me on a variety of ways to solve programming problems. Engineering Design Thinking (ENED 1100) provided a foundation for me to learn programming in general, as well as how to solve most of the problems I will encounter during my project.

My Co-Op experiences will assist me as well. At Siemens Digital Industries Software as a Web Developer, I learned version control in a job setting. I also shipped software to real production where it was used by others. I fixed bugs, and maintained the quality of my software. During my EEP in 2024, I completed a webapp project by myself, and was successfully able to manage my time effectively and deliver a finished product. At Cincinnati Children's Medical Center as a Software Engineer, I once again worked on web applications, but refined my programming ability through code reviews from other developers. These experiences both inside and outside the classroom have led me to the programming abilities I have today, and will inform the decisions I make during my project.

My desire to create a game others can enjoy is my main motivation for the project. I want my senior design project to be an enjoyable time, and this is an area I am interested in. I also wanted to do a project that both incorporates my skillset and teaches me something new. I have done a lot of programming projects, but mostly web applications. I see this project as a way to diversify my resume. I also am motivated to learn more about game development and a new area of software engineering.

My expected result is a finished web browser game that can be played by anyone at UC, and a new project that I am proud to put on my resume. My goal to designing a solution is based on what I want the end product to be. I know I'd like a web-based game, so I know I should use a game development tool such as Unity or Godot. I know I want to market this project to employers, so I've chosen to use Unity since it is in C# instead of proprietary GDScript and is used frequently in industry. I will know I have finished the project when the main goal is completed. I'd like to have the game in a playable form to be presented next year.
