As a University of Cincinnati student, I want a public leaderboard and easy sharing functionality so that I may share the game with my friends.

As an experienced gamer, I want to experience an unlimited number of waves and solve said waves with a variety of solutions so that the game I'm playing has a satisfying gameplay loop.

As an unexperienced gamer, I want the game's controls to be intuitive and access to playing it to be easy so that I can play without too much prior knowledge.
